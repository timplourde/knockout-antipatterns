        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
            This tutorial is heavily inspired by <a href="http://vimeo.com/73627803">this talk by Ryan Niemeyer</a>  and my own experience in building non-trivial apps with <a href="http://http://knockoutjs.com/">Knockout</a>.  It's purpose is to identify common anti-paterns in Knockout-heavy apps and suggest ways to avoid them.
        </p>

        <p>
            Before we begin it's very important to <strong>emphasize the importance of unit testing</strong>.  If you are not unit-testing your Knockout ViewModels with something like <a href="http://qunitjs.com/">QUnit</a> or <a href="http://pivotal.github.io/jasmine/">Jasmine</a>, just stop reading.  Nothing is more vital to the long-term health of a JavaScript app than solid unit test coverage.  If you find writing unit tests difficult, come back and see if applying some of the solutions below helps with testability.</p>

        <h2>1. Separation of Concerns</h2>

        <p>Knockout is great because it does one thing very well: data binding.  After just a few hours learning Knockout, you be building complex apps and impressing your friends in no time.</p>

        <p>
            The key to making sure those fancy apps are testable and maintainable is to separate your concerns via the <a href="http://addyosmani.com/resources/essentialjsdesignpatterns/book/#detailmvvm">MVVM pattern</a>.
            Don't worry if you don't have a PhD in MVVM.  The main thing you need to remember is <strong>the View (HTML, CSS, DOM) should not know about the ViewModel</strong>.  This simple rule will help you build testable and maintainable apps.
        </p>

        <div class="anti-pattern">
            <h3>
                (Anti-)Pattern 1.1: DOM Manipulation in Knockout ViewModels
            </h3>
            <div class="anti-pattern-content">
                <p>
                    Once your VM has any knowledge of the DOM then it knows about your View.  This breaks MVVM, makes unit testing more cumbersome (because you need to set up / tear down DOM nodes) and results in brittle code.  With Knockout binding handlers there is really no reason to have any DOM-related code in your ViewModels.
                </p>

                <div class="examples">

                    <div class="example bad">
                        <p>
                            In this example, we want to fade in / out a message on the last name field when the first name field changes. We decided to use <span class="code">.subscribe()</span> and jQuery.
                        </p>

                    <div class="example good">
                        <p>
                            There are several ways to solve this.  In this case we moved the fade in / out behavior to a custom binding handler.

                <p>
                    This is contraversial since it appears in the <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/documentation/css-binding.html">Knockout documentation</a>.  Avoid generating CSS class names from ViewModels if those class names have no semantic meaning and only exist for visual styling.
                </p>

                    <div class="example bad">
                        <p>
                            In this example, we want use CSS to set the color of the first name text box if we know the gender.  We did this using the default CSS binding handler, binding to a computed in the ViewModel.

                        <p>
                            Since the computed was returning view-specific non-semantic CSS class names, we moved it to a custom binding handler.  It would be even simpler if you could rename the CSS class names to something more semantic like "male" and "female" and just bind directly to it without the need fo the binding handler to do the translation.

                    constructor function since it directly affects the DOM and should really only be run once.

                            This ViewModel has a ko.applyBindings() call inside it.  This means the ViewModel is directly interacting with the View.  It also means every time you construct a ViewModel, it will re-bind, potentially resulting in extra event handlers.

        <p>
            Premature optimization may be the <a href="http://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">root of all evil</a>, but be prudent in your use of knockout's powerful observables. Too many subscriptions can lead to performance issues which can be tough to refactor in large code bases.</p>
